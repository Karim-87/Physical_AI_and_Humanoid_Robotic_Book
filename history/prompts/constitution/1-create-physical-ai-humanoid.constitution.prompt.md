## Prompt

```text
/sp.constitution

Project Name: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Essentials

Purpose:
Create a short, clean, professional AI-Native textbook based on the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course.
The book must serve as a fast, simple, high-quality learning resource built with a modern Docusaurus UI
and a fully integrated free-tier RAG chatbot.

Scope:
- 6 short chapters:
  1. Introduction to Physical AI
  2. Basics of Humanoid Robotics
  3. ROS 2 Fundamentals
  4. Digital Twin Simulation (Gazebo + Isaac)
  5. Vision-Language-Action Systems
  6. Capstone: Simple AI-Robot Pipeline
- Clean UI
- Free-tier friendly
- Lightweight embeddings

Core Principles:
- Simplicity
- Accuracy
- Minimalism
- Fast builds
- Free-tier architecture
- RAG answers ONLY from book text

Key Features:
- Docusaurus textbook
- RAG chatbot (Qdrant + Neon + FastAPI)
- Select-text → Ask AI
- Optional Urdu / Personalize features

Constraints:
- No heavy GPU usage
- Minimal embeddings

Success Criteria:
- Bu
```
